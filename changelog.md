* Fix bug where selected words were sometimes not being capitalized when they were supposed to be.
* Fix bug where plugin would crash if more than two spaces were selected in between words.
* Add menu option and capability to capitalize the first letter of the first word of all of the sentences in the document.

#####Version 0.01 -- 06.03.2016
